<p>One measureable type of potential human-related water pollution is fecal bacteria. Such bacteria may derive directly from humans, from the various domestic animals with which we are associated and/or from wild creatures over which we have little, if any, control. For well over half a century scientists have had the capability to test for the bacteria that are indigenous to the gut of warm-blooded animals and for over 30 years total <i>Enterococcus</i> bacteria has been widely used to indicate the presence of such in 305(b) monitoring efforts, including in Delaware.  Delaware has risk-based numeric criteria for <a href = "http://regulations.delaware.gov/AdminCode/title7/7000/7400/7401.shtml">Primary Contact Recreation (PCR) and Secondary Contact Recreation (SCR) in freshwater and saltwater “determined by the Department (DNREC) to be of non-wildlife origin based on best scientific judgment using available information”.</a> Important among the limitations of the Enterococcus test is that it does not differentiate as to what type of animal the detected bacteria are from.  It could be any mix of warm-blooded animal types that might be in the watershed – i.e. mammals and birds, domestic and wildlife.</p>

<p>The Inland Bays are designated as Exceptional Recreational of Ecological Significance (ERES) waters under the State’s water quality standards and as such are subject to a priority degree of protection relative to areas not so designated.  The tidal waters are heavily used recreationally in mostly forms of SCR such as crabbing, fishing, kayaking and canoeing. There is a high use boat ramp, where wading in water and mud to get small boats off trailers is likely, particularly at low tide. PCR is much less evident though it seems possible that juveniles and young adults might occasionally be found doing things like rolling kayaks or jumping off docks on hot days during times of high tide.  There is also substantial personal watercraft (jet ski) traffic and paddle boarding is a rapidly increasing form of recreation that has a high likelihood of ending up being PCR. Overall, anyone exposed to ambient water with open breaks in their skin and particularly those who are immunocompromised are at higher risk of bacterial infection.  The lower part of the tidal segment, from the mouth of Arnell Creek to Rehoboth Bay is open to recreational clamming, done by raking, which often ends up in full immersion.</p>
